# Stat540-Final-Project-2023
Project Objective: 

Leading up to the 2016 presidential election, many pollsters predicted that the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, would win a "decisive victory.". However, as we all know, the election was won by the Republican candidate, and current president, Donald Trump. In general biases, not accounted for by prediction models, often affect many pollsters. In this project, you are going to further investigate these biases through comparisons across both national and state-level races.
